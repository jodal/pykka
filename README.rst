=====
Pykka
=====

Pykka is a Python implementation of the `actor model
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_. The actor model introduces some
simple rules to control the sharing of state and cooperation between execution
units, which makes it easier to build concurrent applications.

For details and code examples, see the `Pykka documentation
<https://pykka.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Pykka is available from PyPI. To install it, run::

    pip install pykka

Pykka works with Python 3.6+. If you need support for Python 2.7 or 3.5, you
can use Pykka 2.x.
