Pykka
=====

Pykka is a Python implementation of the `actor model
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>`_. The actor model introduces some
simple rules to control the sharing of state and cooperation between execution
units, which makes it easier to build concurrent applications.

For details and code examples, see the `Pykka documentation
<https://pykka.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Pykka is available from PyPI. To install it, run::

    pip install pykka

Pykka works with Python 3.8 or newer.


Inspiration
===========

Much of the naming of concepts and methods in Pykka is taken from the `Akka
<https://akka.io/>`_ project which implements actors on the JVM. Though, Pykka
does not aim to be a Python port of Akka, and supports far fewer features.

Notably, Pykka **does not** support the following features:

- Supervision: Linking actors, supervisors, or supervisor groups.

- Remoting: Communicating with actors running on other hosts.

- Routers: Pykka does not come with a set of predefined message routers, though
  you may make your own actors for routing messages.
