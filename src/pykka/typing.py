"""The :mod:`pykka.typing` module contains helpers to improve type hints.

Since Pykka 4.0, Pykka has complete type hints for the public API, tested using
both `Mypy <https://www.mypy-lang.org/>`_ and `Pyright
<https://github.com/microsoft/pyright>`_.

Due to the dynamic nature of :class:`~pykka.ActorProxy` objects, it is not
possible to automatically type them correctly. This module contains helpers to
manually create additional classes that correctly describe the type hints for
the proxy objects. In cases where a proxy objects is used a lot, this might be
worth the extra effort to increase development speed and catch bugs earlier.

Example usage::

    from typing import cast

    from pykka import ActorProxy, ThreadingActor
    from pykka.typing import ActorMemberMixin, proxy_field, proxy_method


    # 1) The actor class to be proxied is defined as usual:

    class CircleActor(ThreadingActor):
        pi = 3.14

        def area(self, radius: float) -> float:
            return self.pi * radius**2


    # 2) In addition, a proxy class is defined, which inherits from ActorMemberMixin
    # to get the correct type hints for the actor methods:

    class CircleProxy(ActorMemberMixin, ActorProxy[CircleActor]):

        # For each field on the proxy, a proxy_field is defined:
        pi = proxy_field(CircleActor.pi)

        # For each method on the proxy, a proxy_method is defined:
        area = proxy_method(CircleActor.area)


    # 3) The actor is started like usual, and a proxy is created as usual, but the
    # proxy is casted to the recently defined proxy class:
    proxy = cast(CircleProxy, CircleActor.start().proxy())


    # Now, the type hints for the proxy are correct:

    reveal_type(proxy.stop)
    # Revealed type is 'Callable[[], pykka.Future[None]]'

    reveal_type(proxy.pi)
    # Revealed type is 'pykka.Future[float]'

    reveal_type(proxy.area))
    # Revealed type is 'Callable[[float], pykka.Future[float]]'
