class Actor(object):
    """
    To create an actor:

    1. subclass one of the :class:`Actor` implementations, e.g.
       :class:`GeventActor <pykka.gevent.GeventActor>` or
       :class:`ThreadingActor`,
    2. implement your methods, including :meth:`__init__`, as usual,
    3. call :meth:`Actor.start` on your actor class, passing the method any
       arguments for your constructor.

    To stop an actor, call :meth:`Actor.stop()` or :meth:`ActorRef.stop()`.

    For example::

        import pykka

        class MyActor(pykka.ThreadingActor):
            def __init__(self, my_arg=None):
                super(MyActor, self).__init__()

            def on_start(self):
                ... # My optional setup code in same context as on_receive()

            def on_stop(self):

              object for safely communicating with the actor.

           4. At this point, your :meth:`__init__()` code can run.

        2. The actor is registered in :class:`pykka.ActorRegistry`.

        3. The actor receive loop is started by the actor's associated
           thread/greenlet.
